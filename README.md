Tutorial and Links For Learning GitHub

In Simple words,
In GitHub we propose a small changes in code by correcting it and then requesting the admin/member of that organisation to approve it. 

How do we do it then?
At Beginning we start by doing easy contributions. What's that?
Any Typo error or update in readme, or translating readme to your language etc are considered easy tasks on github.

Then, we approach towards coding stuff.

Step 1: Explore Projects in Github, Find a suitable project (According to what you are very well comfortable with eg. C++/Java/Web Dev etc).

Step 2: Analyze the code, understand it's working. Then See the issues created by other users and try to build a solution and implement in code.

Step 3: Commit those correction in real file and let it get approved. Voila! you have contributed on Github.

In shorts basic github workflow is as follows:-
1.Fork the project
2.Create a topic branch from master.
3.Make some commits to improve the project.
4.Push this branch to your GitHub project.
5.Open a Pull Request on GitHub.
6.Discuss, and optionally continue committing.
7.The project owner merges or closes the Pull Request.
